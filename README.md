spark-knn-recommender
===========

Spark-knn-recommender is a fast, scalable recommendation engine built on top of [PySpark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html), the Python API for [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). It can be deployed locally or on [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/).

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.7.3
* Spark >= 0.7.0
* Numpy

Installation
------------

First, clone this repo onto your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/evancasey/spark-knn-recommender.git
```

Set your spark cluster configuration in config.py:
```python

# change if you are running on Amazon EMR
CLUSTER_CONFIG = "local"

# fill this in with pySpark path
PYSPARK_HOME = "../spark/pyspark"
SPARKLER_HOME = "../spark/python/sparkler"
```

In the root directory, run:
```bash
$ python setup.py
```

Using spark-knn-recommender
--------------
Run:
```bash
$ python train_and_test.py
```


Running on Amazon EMR
---------------------

* create an Amazan Web Services Account
* sign up for Elastic MapReduce
* install the [Amazon EMR CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-cli-install.html)

Run the Spark/Shark bootstrap script:
```bash
$ ./elastic-mapreduce --create --alive --name "Spark/Shark Cluster"  --bootstrap-action s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/spark/0.8.1/install-spark-shark.sh --bootstrap-name "Spark/Shark"  --instance-type m1.xlarge --instance-count 3 --jobflow-role spark
Created job flow j-2Y0VECUPLFW94
```

SSH into the master node of your cluster (replace the job ID below with your job ID):

```bash
./elastic-mapreduce -j j-2Y0VECUPLFW94 --ssh
```
